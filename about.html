        <p>
          Hey! My name is Kyle and I'm a web developer based in Atlanta, GA. My
          interest in coding began back in my high school days when I was using Tumblr
          to modify my personal "website" with the help of HTML. This got my creative
          juices flowing and I knew this was something I'd want to master. Social outlets
          like Tumblr allow users to be expressive and because of that I've developed
          keen eyesight for minimalistic yet striking web designs.
          I've recently started taking coding more seriously and have
          learned far more about HTML, CSS and other languages!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          With my new found passion for web design and engineering,
          I'm excited to perfect my craft and further my 
          knowledge and skills in the hopes of creating innovative, 
          people-friendly apps that can potentially change 
          the lives of many. Please check out my projects to see 
          what I've been working on!
        </p>
